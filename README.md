# Inventory-Database
This is a database made with SQL and Visual Basic Access. It is meant to simulate an inventory for a food shelter or cupboard.
Allows the user to insert data into a database. The user(s) can put the name of the item, update its stock, and keep track of peopleâ€™s family members in this. The options to add the name and stock of the item will prevent confusion and promote consistency. Being able to keep track of the family members prevents any dishonesty from the consumers. It also makes it easier to understand the needs for a family based on the number of members it has.
